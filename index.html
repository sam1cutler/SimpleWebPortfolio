          <h2>Hello! I'm Sam Cutler.</h2>
          <p>I'm an aspiring software developer based in Seattle, WA.</p>
          <p>In the code I write, I aspire to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Item one.</li>
            <li>Item two.</li>
            <li>Item three.</li>

          <h2>About me</h2>
          <p>I graduated from Amherst College with a degree in Biology. After college, 
            I spent a year teaching English in China, then returned to the U.S., working for 
            two years in Boston, MA as a research technician studying the immune response to HIV infection.</p>
          <p>I then moved to Seattle, where I earned a PhD in molecular and cellular biology at the University of Washington,
            with my doctoral research focused on how DNA is packaged and organized in cells.
            While working conducting this research, I learned some Python, Bash, and R, and found that I loved programming.</p>
          <p>After completing my PhD, I worked as an undergraduate biology lecturer, and I am now working to transition to 
            a career in software development. </p>
