          <h2>Hello! I'm Sam Cutler.</h2>
          <p>I'm an aspiring software developer based in Seattle, WA.</p>
          <p>With the code I write, I hope to contribute efficiency and functionality to digital tools.</p>

          <h2>About me</h2>
          <p>Since graduating from Amherst College with a degree in biology, I have...</p>
          <ol>
            <li>taught high school English in Hunan Province, China</li>
            <li>worked as a research technician in Boston, MA, studying 
              <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nm.3229">the immune response to HIV infection</a></li>
            <li>earned a PhD in molecular and cellular biology at the University of Washington, with doctoral research focused on 
              <a href="https://www.genetics.org/content/210/4/1543.long">how DNA is packaged and organized in cells</a></li>
            <li>taught undergraduate biology classes at the University of Washington and Edmonds Community College</li>
          </ol>
          <p>While conducting my PhD research, I used a lot of Python, Bash, and R, and found that I loved programming. 
            In particular, I found it immensely gratifying to use R to create beautiful, publication-quality figures that looked just how I wanted; 
            or to write Python scripts that could efficiently analyze huge, genome-wide data sets; 
            or to create Bash scripts that could transform three hours of painstaking, repetitive typing at the command-line 
            into a simple process of "run one script, go have lunch, and come back to folders full of neatly analyzed data"! Based largely on that experience, 
            I am now extremely excited to be pursuing a career in software development.</p>
          <p>Outside of my interests in programming/science/teaching, I love to spend as much time as possible in the outdoors, whether
            rock climbing, hiking, backpacking, biking, or snowboarding.</p>
