          <h2>Hello! I'm Sam Cutler.</h2>
          <p>I'm an aspiring software developer based in Seattle, WA.</p>
          <p>In the code I write, I hope to contribute efficiency and functionality to digital tools.</p>

          <h2>About me</h2>
          <p>Since graduating from Amherst College with a degree in biology, I have...</p>
          <ul>
            <li>taught high school English in rural Hunan Province, China</li>
            <li>worked as a research technician in Boston, MA, studying the immune response to HIV infection</li>
            <li>earned a PhD in molecular and cellular biology at the University of Washington,
              with my doctoral research focused on how DNA is packaged and organized in cells</li>
            <li>taught undergraduate biology classes at the University of Washington and Edmonds Community College</li>
          </ul>
          <p>While conducting my PhD research, I used a lot of Python, Bash, and R, and found that I loved programming. 
            In particular, I found it immenseley gratifying to write Python scripts that could efficiently analyze
            huge genome-wide data sets, or to make Bash scripts that could transform three hours of painstaking command-line typing 
            into a single "run the script, go have lunch, and come back to folders full of neatly analyzed data"! Based on that experience, 
            I am now excited to be transitioning to a career in software development.</p>
          <p>Outside of my interests in programming/science/teaching, I love to spend as much time as possible in the outdoors, whether
            rock climbing, hiking, backpacking, biking, or snowboarding.</p>
